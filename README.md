# Title

testing integration between github and gitbook.io....

now this is something that could lead somewhere

> well this is a quote

```java
 @Override
    public void celebrate(Cake c) {
        age++;
        cake = c;
    }
```

more code...

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TestShape {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();
        shapes.add(new Square(5));
        shapes.add(new Circle(2));

        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            System.out.println(s);
            System.out.println(" Area: " + s.area());
            System.out.println(" Perimeter: " + s.perimeter());
        }
    }
}

```

it is weidely known that as you type things tend to appear in the screen

looks like I can double-return which is good

this is essentially a variation of notion

is this better than notion?

good question
